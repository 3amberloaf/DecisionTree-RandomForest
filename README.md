**Project Overview**

In this report, I will be comparing two popular classification algorithms, C4.5 Decision Tree
(Category 3) and Random Forest (Category 2). For both algorithms, I will analyze three different
datasets and compare their results using both Pycharm and Weka. Throughout my explanation, I
will use pre-existing packages, such as sklearn, to implement these algorithms and demonstrate
the processes. In the end, I will provide the datasets and Weka source code to support the results. The report
will conclude with a short summary and an analysis of the algorithms.
